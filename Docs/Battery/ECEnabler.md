# Battery: Patch macOS to read battery reports without splitting `FieldUnitObjs`-ECEnabler.kext
## Problem
- There's a kext that patches macOS to read and write ACPI `FieldUnitObjs`s without the need to split them called [ECEnabler](https://github.com/1Revenger1/ECEnabler) thanks to 1Revenger1. I've tested it, and it works. However, while it works for the current kernels, it may break in the future. Also, I already have working battery status with ACPI patches, and two of the patches cannot be done with ECEnabler.kext. One is to fix charging status by modifying the status reported in `FBST`. The other one is [Hibernate at low battery level](hibernate-at-low-battery-level.md) which requires lines of code inserted inside `_BST`. These two do not concern splitting `FieldUnitObjs`, thus still needing to rely on ACPI modification on battery even if I chose to switch to ECEnabler. It's your choice whether to use this kext or not, and, if you do, you need to delete patches . But it would certainly come in handy if you get a new laptop and feel lazy about patching ACPI for working battery status.
